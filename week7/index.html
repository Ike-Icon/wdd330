      <h2>Further Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Since functions are first-class objects, they are able to have their own
        attributes and methods. For instance, the length attribute of all
        functions returns how many parameters the function has. <br />In
        JavaScript, you can add properties to any object, therefore there is
        nothing stopping you from doing the same with functions.
      </p>
      <h3>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h3>
      <p>
        An Immediately Invoked Function Expression - or IIFE (pronounced “iffy”)
        – is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as
        soon as it' s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at
        the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to
        invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression,
        which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses.
        example:
      </p>
      <p>
        (function(){
        <br />
        const temp = 'World'; <br />
        console.log(`Hello ${temp}`); <br />
        })();
      </p>
      <h2>Clients and Servers</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting language,
        meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding dynamic features to
        the web page that was returned from the server. Ajax allows JavaScript
        to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The
        resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or
        HTML rather than a whole web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fetch API is, at the time of writing, what is known as a “living
        standard”, which means that the specification is being developed in the
        wild . This means that, despite it being available to use, it’s still
        subject to change as developers, browser vendors and end-users provide
        feedback about how it works. It’s an experimental technology, and new
        features might get added, or the syntax and behavior of some properties
        and methods might change in the future.
