    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
    <p>They are usually
      caused by one of the following:
      <br>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with
      which the program is interacting.
      <br>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
      could even be as simple as a typo.</br>
      User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
    </p>
    <h2>Exceptions
    </h2>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
      program to deal with the error.
    </p>
    <h2>Stack Traces</h2>
    <p>An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or
      method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a
      single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work
      backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original
      function or method that started the sequence.
    </p>
    <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
    <p>ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and
      warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
      <br>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a
      JavaScript file:
      <br><strong>'use strict';</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
    <p>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is
      ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production,
      however, it will appear as if the program has crashed, which does not reflect well
      on a programmer.</p>
