        <h3>Always keep these steps in mind as a developer;</h3>

    <p><strong>Think- </strong>Think about what the customer wants. What type of knowledge is required to create what the customer wants? Do I already have this knowledge? Remember, there is no replacement for experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Design- </strong>You decide how it will behave, look and interact with other things. Planning is vital to software development.</p>
    <p><strong>Test- </strong>Decide what standards your product will meet when it is done. In software, this consists of User Interaction testing, Unit Testing, Component Testing, System Testing, Installation Testing, and Figuring it out with details, deep texting, or Debugging. If you think your software can not be tested or be something that does not exist, then your <strong>Think</strong> and <strong>Design</strong> steps are not well in place.</p>
    <p><strong>Create- </strong>Begin building. Based on the first 3 steps, you can now code to start developing.</p>
