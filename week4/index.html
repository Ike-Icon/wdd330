      <h1>Form</h1>
      <p>
        When it comes to forms, there are plenty of usability and accessibility
        considerations to keep in mind, such as using correct and semantic
        markup, making forms keyboard accessible and using WAI-AIRA labels. Most
        of these fall outside the scope of this book, as we’ll be keeping the
        focus on how to use JavaScript to interact with the forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be careful referencing elements in this way, however. If the form had
        the same name as any properties or methods of the document.forms object,
        such as submit, for example, that property or method would be referenced
        instead of the form element. This is unlikely to happen, as the
        document.form object doesn’t have many properties or methods, but it is
        something to be aware of.
      </p>

      <h2>Form Properties and Methods</h2>

      <p>
        Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can be
        used to interact with the form.
      </p>
      <p>
        The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. Note that
        submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form submit event
        that’s covered in the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their
        initial values specified in the HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NB</strong> Reset buttons are generally considered poor for
        usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data
        that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.
      </p>
      <h2>Form Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          'input' fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons,
          and file uploads
        </li>
        <li>'select' menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
        <li>'textarea' elements for longer text entry</li>
        <li>'button' elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Form Validation</h2>
      <p>
        Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered
        the information into a form correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the
        server side. It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side
        validation. JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data
        before it’s saved to a database.
      </p>

      <h1>Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of
        objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP:
        encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
      </p>

      <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
      <p>
        The JavaScript Encapsulation is a process of binding the data (i.e.
        variables) with the functions acting on that data.
      </p>

      <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
      <p>
        The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that
        provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.
      </p>
      <h2>Inheritance</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct:
        objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to
        another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a
        prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as
        its prototype
      </p>
