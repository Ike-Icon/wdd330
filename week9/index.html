      <h2>The Window Object</h2>
      <p>
        In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which
        represents the browser window that contains a web page.The Browser
        Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
        methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM
          only makes sense in a browser environment. This means that other
          environments (such as Node.js) probably won't have a window object,
          although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js
          has an object called global. If you don't know the name of the global
          object, you can also refer to it using the keyword this in the global
          scope.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser
        environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any
        global variable created is actually a property of the window object.
      </p>
      <h3>Controlling Windows</h3>
      <p>
        A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes
        the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window
        title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third
        parameter. <br />The close() method can be used to close a window,
        assuming you have a reference to it: <br /><strong>
          popup.close();</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
      <h3>The data- Attribute</h3>
      <p>
        The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using
        custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private
        to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their
        sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re
        perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program
        utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.
      </p>
      <ul>
        The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they
        must use the following format:
        <li>Start with data-.</li>
        <li>
          Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or
          underscores.
        </li>
        <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
      </ul>
