      <h2>The Window Object</h2>
      <p>
        In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which
        represents the browser window that contains a web page.The Browser
        Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
        methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM
        only makes sense in a browser environment. This means that other
        environments (such as Node.js) probably won't have a window object,
        although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js has
        an object called global. If you don't know the name of the global
        object, you can also refer to it using the keyword this in the global
        scope.</strong>
