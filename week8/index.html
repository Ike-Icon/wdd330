      <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
      <p>
        Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or
        down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative;
        when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and
        right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function,
        you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document.
        Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position an element
        either against its current position or against a parent or other
        ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current
        position.
      </p>
      <h3>Scaling</h3>
      <p>
        The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors
        horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be
        used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or
        pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example,
        scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double
        its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing
        different values will distort the element, as you’d expect:
